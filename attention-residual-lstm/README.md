# Dilated_Res_Attention_LSTM
Simple implementations of Dilated LSTM, Residual LSTM and Attentive LSTM (follow the corresponding papers).
In this repo, we reimplemented Dilated LSTM, Residual LSTM and Attentive LSTM followed by attached papers using Pytorch.
Readers can run the main.py file for testing.
Hope it is useful!
